^graphql_test - name of the db that the document will we saved to! name of the collection will be infered automatically

client -> clone from repo, then hidden folder .git was deleted so this could be one repo consisting of client and server

// useMutation mutate function does not call `onCompleted`!
 // so onCompleted can only be passed to initial hook
// workaround: useMutation returns a Promise

schema.js -> promise used, so that resolve function can return a value from Mongoose method,
which is needed on the pro

testing tokens with postman:
[body-graphql] 1. login querry to geneterate token, copy the token
2. [authorisation beaere token] paste token (without ""!)
3. make protected querry
no body-pareser being used

jwt logic (+ revoking tokens):
1. user logging in -> 
->refresh token is stored in a cookie,
->access token is set in memory(redux store).

2. headers (sent with every request to the server)with accessToken
 are being set in index.jx client side
 (in there the access token is being taken from the redux store)

3. Preserving session (still logged in after reload):
 App.js -> checks is there is a valid refresh token in a cookie by fetching "/refresh_token"
  (an actual second route in server.js)
  and logs In with accessToken if everything is OK
  (another login, so new refreshToken will be stored in a cookie)

4. Handling accessToken expiration during app use -> creating new accessToken if refreshToken is OK
  plus 
  "apollo-link-token-refresh" (ApolloLink -> type of middleware only better) in index.js client-side

5. different mutations/queries in schema.js are being protected by isAuth,
which checks if there is proper accessToken is set in the headers (equivalent of route guarding)

6. logOut -> setting empty string in a cookie instead of token

7. revokingToken: current refresh token won't work 

tokenVersion == 0 when creating user
when creating refreshToken ->refreshTokens' tokenVersion == user.tokenVerssion
to invalidate user -> mutation to increment user's tokenVersion in db
when the user tries to refresh tokens(reloading or after the accessToken runs out),
/refresh_token path checks if his user.tokenVersion match the version from the refresh token in his cookies
if not: new accessToken & refreshToken is not being sent
-user can still use App until accessToken run out (or until he reloads)
BUT new refreshToken would still be created if the user Logs in again -
so password has to be changed first

apollo structure:

in App:
updating stats after counter reaches 0 -> passing addScore to  !!==updateScor_postAction==!!, where getStatsQuerry is refetched

in Stats:
getStatsQuery for setting redux state - stats state is being used in Stats for deleting (moved from App)
updating stats after deleting current stats, refetching getStatsQuery

in Register: adding new user and adding empty score right away (addNewUser_postAction not used anymore!)
