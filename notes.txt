GraphQLNonNull - preventing users from not entering all data in mutation

client -> clone from repo, then hidden folder .git was deleted so this could be one repo consisting of client and server

// useMutation mutate function does not call `onCompleted`!
 // so onCompleted can only be passed to initial hook
// workaround: useMutation returns a Promise

schema.js -> promise used, so that resolve function can return a value from Mongoose method,
which is needed on the pro

testing tokens with postman:
[body-graphql] 1. login querry to geneterate token, copy the token
2. [authorisation beaere token] paste token (without ""!)
3. make protected querry
no body-pareser being used





issues:
DONE 1. React: Login <Route> warning DONE
DONE 2. warning: SingleStat "key" DONE
DONE 3. problems with undefined for disable button itp? DONE (if statements moved to useEffect)
4. changePassword! other repos won't work!
5. clicking Login it the article is not loaded yet couse errors
6. checking if email is already taken: is in Register component, but it would be better if it was in schema.js?
but problems with addingScore to user automatically

to do:
DONE 1. move graphql queries to different file DONE


apollo structure:

in App:
updating stats after counter reaches 0 -> passing addScore to  !!==updateScor_postAction==!!, where getStatsQuerry is refetched

in Stats:
getStatsQuery for setting redux state - stats state is being used in Stats for deleting (moved from App)
updating stats after deleting current stats, refetching getStatsQuery

in Register: adding new user and adding empty score right away (addNewUser_postAction not used anymore!)
