GraphQLNonNull - preventing users from not entering all data in mutation

client -> clone from repo, then hidden folder .git was deleted so this could be one repo consisting of client and server



issues:
DONE 1. React: Login <Route> warning DONE
DONE 2. warning: SingleStat "key" DONE
DONE 3. problems with undefined for disable button itp? DONE (if statements moved to useEffect)
4. changePassword! other repos won't work!
5. clicking Login it the article is not loaded yet couse errors

to do:
1. move graphql queries to different file


apollo structure:

in App:
updating stats after counter reaches 0 -> passing addScore to updateScor_postAction, where getStatsQuerry is refetched

in Stats:
getStatsQuery for setting redux state - stats state is being used in Stats for deleting (moved from App)
updating stats after deleting current stats, refetching getStatsQuery

in Register: adding new user and adding empty score right away -> addNewUser_postAction
